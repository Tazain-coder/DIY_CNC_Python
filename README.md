<h1>DIY CNC machine controller</h1>
here is the code for a simple CNC controller which is made with arduino this very early stage and may have a lot of bugs.
Desclaimer: I did not test any edge case so if anyone wants to improve or help with the program feel free to let me know.

<h2>Usage</h2>
1. Make sure you have python installed </br>
2. Install the requirments.txt file</br>
3. Run the main.py</br>
</br>
at this point you should see an interface. connect your machine to your pc. then select the communication port if it shows up
in the dropdown menu. NOTE: you have to manually select the port it will not auto select. after selecting the port Click on connect
it should say connected if it finds the device. then you can eaither test the device to make sure it is working. or run a gcode file

<h1>IMPORTANT</h1>
I am not that great at programming and this is my first proper project so many things may go wrong i made this for a personal project
that i made. and just for the convinience of gui. if anyone wants to improve please feel free to test and let me know your though.

Also i may need help with using github :P
